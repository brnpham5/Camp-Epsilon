CHC_31_ Well what? Is everything ok?
ENC_
NPC_ It's a summer camp in the Sierras, but that's not really important right now!

ENC_

NPC_ The hinges were busted. I looked inside and everyone was gone.
CHC_48_ Why don't you try to find an adult or cammp coordinator?
CHC_49_ I'm sure someone is jsut playing a practical joke. People are hilarious!
ENC_
NPC_ He's gone, too. I'm telling you. Every. One. Is. Gone.
NPC_ No, it's... This place feels... empty...

ENC_
NPC_ I think I'm ok. You're right. No big deal.
